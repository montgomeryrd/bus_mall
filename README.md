# bus_mall

The bus mall app will randomly select through an array of images and display three at a time.

The user selects an image and then a new set of images will be displayed for the user to make a new selection.

Images are non-recurring.

The app will record the number of times an image is shown as well as the number of times an image has been selected by the user.

After a number of selections, the user will be shown the recorded information.
